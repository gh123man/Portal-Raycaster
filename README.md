# Ray Casting With Portals

This repo contains sample code from an early prototype of [Gate Escape](https://blog.sb1.io/gateescape/). There are likely bugs and other issues since the actual game was totally rewritten in c. Do not expect good performance as I learned early on that Kotlyn and other GC'd languages are not good choices for software render engines. However this should run fine on most modern PCs and a good place to experiment!
